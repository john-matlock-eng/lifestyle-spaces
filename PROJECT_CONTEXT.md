### 🔄 Current Backend Status (51% Coverage)

#### Well-Covered Components (>80%)
- ✅ app/main.py (100%)
- ✅ app/core/config.py (100%)
- ✅ app/models/space.py (95%)
- ✅ app/models/user.py (90%)
- ✅ app/models/invitation.py (87%)
- ✅ app/models/user_profile.py (85%)
- ✅ app/api/routes/health.py (86%)
- ✅ app/services/exceptions.py (100%)

#### Needs Work (<50%)
- 🔴 app/api/routes/user_profile.py (14%)
- 🔴 app/services/cognito.py (16%)
- 🔴 app/services/user_profile.py (22%)
- 🔴 app/services/invitation.py (26%)
- 🔴 app/api/routes/invitations.py (30%)
- 🔴 app/core/database.py (33%)

- 🔴 app/services/space.py (41%)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Critical Routes (User Profile)
- app/api/routes/user_profile.py needs 90 lines covered
- This is blocking frontend integration

### Priority 2: Core Services
- app/services/cognito.py needs 94 lines covered
- app/services/user_profile.py needs 58 lines covered
- app/services/space.py needs 118 lines covered

### Priority 3: Database Layer
- app/core/database.py needs 37 lines covered
- Critical for all operations

## 🗂️ KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions
1. **ADR-001**: Single DynamoDB table design ✅
   - Status: Implemented
   - Location: app/core/database.py
   
2. **ADR-002**: Single Lambda for all backend logic ✅
   - Status: Implemented
   - Handler: lambda_handler.py with Mangum

3. **ADR-003**: TDD mandatory for all development
   - Status: Partially enforced (51% coverage)
   - Target: 100% coverage

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript 5.3, Vite 5, TailwindCSS ✅
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11, Mangum, Boto3 ✅
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront ✅
- **Testing**: Pytest with 51% backend coverage

## 🚧 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Active Blockers
- Backend coverage at 51% (target 100%)
- User profile endpoints need completion
- Cognito integration not fully tested

### Identified Risks
1. **Risk**: Coverage gaps preventing deployment
   - Mitigation: Focus on high-impact routes first
   
2. **Risk**: Lambda package size (need to verify)
   - Mitigation: Check current package size

## 📊 CURRENT METRICS

### Code Quality
- Frontend Coverage: 98.38% ✅
- Backend Coverage: 51% 🟡
- Total Lines: 1231
- Lines Covered: 626
- Lines Missing: 605

### Test Distribution
- Unit Tests: ✅ Present in /tests/unit/
- Integration Tests: ✅ Present in /tests/integration/
- Test Files: 25+ test files created

## 🔄 SESSION HANDOFF

### Current Session Status
- Created PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for continuity
- Created BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md for tracking
- Identified coverage gaps and priorities
- Backend is partially implemented, not a placeholder

### For Next Session
1. Read this PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file
2. Check coverage report in backend/htmlcov/index.html
3. Focus on user_profile.py routes first (14% → 100%)
4. Use Claude Code to fill coverage gaps

## 📋 CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTIONS

### Immediate Tasks for 100% Coverage

#### Task 1: Fix User Profile Routes (CRITICAL)
```bash
@backend-architect analyze app/api/routes/user_profile.py and write comprehensive tests to cover the 90 missing lines. Focus on:
- GET /api/user/profile endpoint
- PUT /api/user/profile endpoint
- POST /api/user/onboarding endpoints
- Error handling paths
```

#### Task 2: Complete Cognito Service Tests
```bash
@backend-architect create comprehensive tests for app/services/cognito.py covering all 94 missing lines including:
- Authentication flows
- Token validation
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases
```

#### Task 3: Database Coverage
```bash
@backend-architect write tests for app/core/database.py to cover the 37 missing lines:
- Connection handling
- Query operations
- Error handling
- Transaction management
```

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS

### Today's Sprint
1. **CRITICAL**: Increase backend coverage to 100%
   - Start with user_profile.py (highest impact)
   - Then cognito.py (authentication critical)
   - Then database.py (core functionality)

2. **Verify Lambda Package**
   - Run build_lambda_package.py
   - Check package size
   - Optimize if needed

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test frontend against backend
   - Verify all API contracts match

### Success Criteria for Today
- [ ] Backend coverage >= 80%
- [ ] All critical routes tested
- [ ] Lambda package < 50MB
- [ ] No failing tests

## 🔗 KEY FILES & LOCATIONS

### Backend Structure
```

├── app/
│   ├── api/routes/      # API endpoints (needs coverage)
│   ├── core/            # Core utilities (partially covered)
│   ├── models/          # Data models (well covered)
│   ├── services/        # Business logic (needs coverage)
│   └── main.py          # FastAPI app (100% covered)
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/            # Unit tests
│   ├── integration/     # Integration tests
│   └── conftest.py      # Test configuration
├── htmlcov/             # Coverage reports
└── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
```

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
cd backend
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# Build Lambda package
python build_lambda_package.py

# Run local server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## ⚡ QUICK WINS TO BOOST COVERAGE

1. **User Profile Routes** (+14% → 28%): 90 lines to cover
2. **Cognito Service** (+16% → 32%): 94 lines to cover  
3. **Database Module** (+33% → 66%): 37 lines to cover

These three files alone would add significant coverage!

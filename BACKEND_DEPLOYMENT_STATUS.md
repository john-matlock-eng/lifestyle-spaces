## 🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS

### Sprint Plan to 100% Coverage

#### Hour 1-2: User Profile Routes
```bash
# Write tests for all user profile endpoints
@backend-architect create comprehensive tests for app/api/routes/user_profile.py covering:
- GET /api/user/profile
- PUT /api/user/profile
- POST /api/user/onboarding/complete
- All error paths
```

#### Hour 3-4: Cognito Service
```bash
# Complete authentication testing
@backend-architect write tests for app/services/cognito.py covering:
- JWT validation
- User authentication
- Token refresh
- Error handling
```

#### Hour 5-6: Space Service
```bash
# Core business logic tests
@backend-architect create tests for app/services/space.py covering:
- Space creation
- Member management
- Invitation handling
- Query operations
```

## 🔗 QUICK REFERENCE

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_user_profile.py -v

# Run only failing tests
pytest --lf

# Check coverage for specific module
pytest --cov=app.api.routes.user_profile --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Coverage Goals
